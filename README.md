# Python Selenium Automation Setup and Execution Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up the Python environment, install Selenium, configure WebDriver for browser automation, and run a sample script using Visual Studio Code (VSC).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python:** Python is the primary programming language for writing automation scripts. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Visual Studio Code (VSC):** VSC is a code editor that provides excellent support for Python development. You can download VSC from: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. **Chrome or Firefox Browser:** Selenium typically works with popular web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox. Make sure you have one of these browsers installed.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Install Python

- Download the latest version of Python from the official website.

- Run the installer and check the "Add Python x.x to PATH" option during installation.

- Open a command prompt or terminal and verify Python installation by running the following command:

  ```bash
  python --version

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code
- Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.

- Open Visual Studio Code and install Python extension if prompted.

### 3. Install Selenium
- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Install Selenium using pip, which is the Python package manager:

bash
pip install selenium

### 4. Download WebDriver
- To automate web browsers, you'll need the appropriate WebDriver for the browser you plan to use.

- For Chrome, download ChromeDriver: ChromeDriver Downloads

- For Firefox, download geckodriver: GeckoDriver Downloads

- Place the downloaded WebDriver executable in a location that is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

### 5. Running the Script
- Now that you've set up your environment, you can run a sample Python script using Selenium.

- Open Visual Studio Code.

- Create a new Python file or open an existing one.

- Copy and paste your Python script into the file.

- Save the file with a .py extension.

- Open a terminal within Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+`) and navigate to the directory containing your Python script.

- Run your Python script using the following command:

bash

python your_script.py

Replace your_script.py with the actual name of your Python script.

That's it! Your Selenium automation script should now execute within Visual Studio Code using the specified WebDriver.

Please note that this README provides a basic setup guide. Depending on your specific project and requirements, you may need to install additional libraries or configure WebDriver for other browsers. Be sure to refer to the documentation of the tools and libraries you're using for more advanced usage.
